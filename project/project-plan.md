## Title

Labor Forces in Motion: The Economic Consequences of Immigration in the North and South America

## Main Question

1. What are the economic effects of immigration on labor markets in North and South America?

## Description

In my data science project, "Labor Forces in Motion: The Economic Effects of Immigration to North and South America” I plan to examine how immigration affects labour markets in distinct regions within the Americas. This paper shows that immigration has important consequences on employment, wages, and the skill mix, but these results depend on structures and policies.

As for this, open datasets from the World Bank Data Portal will be utilized in the research. With these datasets, I shall look at various aspects such as labor participation, income changes as well as employment rates of the immigrant groups in the North and South American countries. As for data analysis, I will use methods which are based on statistical data of migration, as well as data visualization, which will reveal correlation and pattern detection, and machine learning approaches to forecast long-term economic impact of migration.

The research aim of the project is to identify the factors that could be used to address the existing imbalances in the Americas’ economies while prompting employment stability. It is my linear intent to bring forth empirical insights as to the rather complex ramifications that have its citings on the economy.

* Data Type: CSV

My given dataset of the World Bank contains labor force statistics in the countries of North, and South America. They are the overall employment index, which can include metrics such as total labor force participation so that development of employment and forces of the workforce in different economies in the Americas can be evaluated. This data is helpful for examining situations that result from changes in economics such as immigration by providing the labor data of countries over a period.
